<h3>Goals In Life / Dream </h3>   
<p> I have a lot of aspirations that have shaped my life and my journey. Since I was a kid, I’ve always looked up to my lolo (grandfather), who became a significant influence on my upbringing. He was a lawyer, and seeing the impact he made in his field inspired me to consider following in his footsteps. His profession has always been something I admire, and I still hold a deep respect for it today. However, as much as I admire the legal profession, my true passion lies in music. 
    From a young age, I’ve been drawn to the world of sound, and this love for music was further nurtured by my lolo. He introduced me to various genres and musicians, sparking my dream of pursuing music seriously. I play in a band, and after I graduate from college, my goal is to pursue a career in music. Specifically, I want to become a rock icon like Angus Young, whose energy and dedication to his craft have always inspired me. As an IT student, 
    I’m also focused on building a solid career in technology, combining my love for music with the skills I am learning in this field. I want to explore how technology can influence and enhance the music industry. Whether through sound engineering, creating innovative music apps, or contributing to the growth of the digital music scene, my journey in IT and music is just beginning, and I’m excited to see where it leads.</p>
